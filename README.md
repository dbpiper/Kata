# Kata
An application I have created which is used to select Katas/Exercises randomly.

# Setup
This project requires PyYAML for parsing its data files.

Thus to build you must follow the steps to get [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation) working described at the PyYAML link.

Basically you must install python (3) and pip and then do ```pip install pyyaml```.

Then the path to your python 3 executable must be provided in Configuration/Helper_Code/python_path.txt.
