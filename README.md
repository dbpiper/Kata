# Kata
An application I have created which is used to select Katas/Exercises randomly.

The purpose is to select various Music and Drawing/Painting subjects with which to practice. This is accomplished as randomly as possible with some weighting based on commonality and thus importance, with respect to both Music Theory and Taxonomy/Biology. As a result, it captures some interesting Biological relationships.
